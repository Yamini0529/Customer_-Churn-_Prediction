# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
Built a machine learning model to predict customer churn using Python. 
The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation with Random Forest and XGBoost.

## Key Steps
- Data preprocessing and EDA using Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.
- Model training and performance comparison (Random Forest vs XGBoost).
- Used SMOTE to handle class imbalance and improve recall by 25%.
- Visualized feature importance and churn insights.

## Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter

## Results
Achieved 85% accuracy and improved customer retention insights.
